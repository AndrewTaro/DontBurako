# Don't Burako
This mod removes the ship's "wiggle" effect caused by waves, while keeping the sea visuals intact.

To be more precise, it separates the wave and ship physics, so you enjoy a stable gameplay without sacrificing all the beauty of the dynamic sea!

"Don't Burako" — a pun on the Japanese onomatopoeia "donburako" (どんぶらこ), which is the sound of something bobbing and floating along in the water, like a log… or a peach in a fairy tale.  

# Install

3. Move them to `(wows)/bin/(latest_number)/res_mods/`. So the path will look like `res_mods/spaces/...`.
4. Done!
